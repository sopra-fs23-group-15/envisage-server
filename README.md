## Introduction
In ENVISAGE, you and your friends can compete against each other over multiple rounds to create the best AI generated masterpieces. At the beginning of the first round, you are given a picture from the category you choose and an image style as a requirement. Your task is to generate an image as close as possible to the requirements. At the end of each round, you get to vote on your favorite picture (not your own!) and the best picture is given as the prompt for the next round with a different style requirement. The process continues till the final round is completed and a winner is declared based on the accumulated votes.
